# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Machine Learning Project â€“ How to Detect Credit Card Fraud
The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions.
We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one.
By the end of this machine learning project, 
we will implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.
